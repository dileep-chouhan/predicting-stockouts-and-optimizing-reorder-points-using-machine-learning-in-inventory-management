# Predicting Stockouts and Optimizing Reorder Points using Machine Learning in Inventory Management

## Overview

This project aims to improve inventory management efficiency by predicting stockouts and optimizing reorder points.  We leverage machine learning techniques to analyze historical sales data, incorporating external factors where applicable, to build a predictive model. This model helps businesses reduce inventory holding costs while simultaneously minimizing the risk of stockouts, leading to improved profitability and customer satisfaction.  The analysis involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and finally, the generation of optimized reorder point recommendations.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* (Add any other libraries used here)


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.  Then, install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will execute the entire analysis pipeline, from data loading and preprocessing to model training and output generation.


## Example Output

The script will print key analysis results and insights to the console, including model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).  Additionally, the script generates visualizations, such as:

* `sales_trend.png`: A plot showing the trend of historical sales data.
* (Add any other generated plots here)

These output files will be saved in the project's directory.  The optimized reorder points calculated by the model will also be displayed in the console and potentially saved to a separate file (depending on the implementation).
